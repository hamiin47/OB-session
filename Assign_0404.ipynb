it was fine .\\n29

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                                                           Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

           30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n41

                             , but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .\\n42

                                               There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                                           But there are

minutes .\\n63

problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .\\n66

for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .\\n70

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

                                       Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of

above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast

contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem

                                                 It doesn't take long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .\\n34

               It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40

it found the satellites very quickly .\\n42

there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46

design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34

minutes .\\n63

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72

                           The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

there's plenty of places to eat outside the hotel, there's a mini Tesco for groceries, a larger grocery store   plenty of internet cafe's, a Paul's Boulangerie right by the tube, great fro a quick

the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n136

                                       Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .\\n8

above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !\\n10

contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem

uncomfortable seats .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                           It cost me thousands of dollars to get rid of it, but the seats gave me and my wife back pain after 20 minutes of driving !\\n11

very uncomfortable, especially on a long drive .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                              The seats are decent, the interior design is excellent IMO as well as the exterior design, and thus far it has been extremely reliable .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In

                 The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats .\\n16

with leather seats .\\n17                                                                                                                                                               Only needs to add drivers seat memory, 2, tone perforated leather, xenons, rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats, and better tilt .\\n18

reason I was able to go back the the Honda family .\\n19

drove an EX, L and felt the seats were too firm plus, the EX, L seemed too slow .\\n21

                                                                                                                 Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person .\\n23

in the front and rear .\\n24

considering the L to drive one for awhile if you can ,  some cannot stand the seats .\\n28

.\\n29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

barely warm, the sound system is pathetic and the brakes wore out around 15,000 miles google it .\\n75

driving it for a few months I found the seats are tough on the lower back on long runs and it need a few more inches to go back .\\n77



                                           The bathroom was large and private .\\n45

to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49

outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

     Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

                                                   The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n4

Windows Peek, and the Aero environment .\\n5                                                                                                                                               If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n6                                                                                                                                  After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7

ever offered .\\n8                                                                                                                                 Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You can read

features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .\\n23

                       It has some features that I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .\\n25

Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

those things are there if I need them .\\n29                                                                     I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

     Did I mention that Win7 offers nothing in terms of any new worthwhile features ?\\n31

headaches !\\n32

                                         It still works pretty good though, just a lack of some features that i had before .\\n49

low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .\\n52

have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

       I am not going to review the features, because there's plenty of that already .\\n60

The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n11

 I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .\\n12

out of a screen  , but on occasion it will zoom when you don't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .\\n13

                         The touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                                       All features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .\\n42

                                 the screen is STUNNING, and if you've got a bright light shining down on it, you've got a choice :\\n44

come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47

want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

features  impressed me .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

                                                      The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57

easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

                               The only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .\\n137

should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a

to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

more visible .\\n165

standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32

blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

                                  The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41

to a lot of great miles with this car .\\n101

commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29                                                                                                                                    great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30                                                                                                         You can't have it both ways, either a car is full of power and stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                            The driver's seat is really comfortable .\\n34                                                                                             I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                                                                                    The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                       Front seats are not comfortable on long trip .\\n40                                                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

                                                             The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet interior .\\n48                                                                                                                                                          Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49

                                                                                                                               Trunk is big and rear seat very comfortable for 2 and will seat 3 .\\n51

great for my 6'1  250 lbs .\\n52                                                                                                                I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54

Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90

has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106

may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                   The 190 hp I4 engine is powerful and smooth enough to enjoy, without sacrificing fuel mileage .\\n23

                                   the variable cylinder management changes to 4 cyl when not under load, this helps with fuel mileage .\\n33

             It's no 8 cylinder GT, but it also gets double the gas mileage and so far, no problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40                                                                                                                                                     The car is getting

                                            Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14 .\\n42

                                       In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62

                                                                                                                       I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66

                                                                        Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71

models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80

                                                                                                            The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86

            I am not known to drive slowly so I am pleased with the mileage .\\n89                                                                                                         We bought

                                             So far, the reliability has been as expected, it is comfortable on my back, and the gas mileage has been pretty good .\\n91

                                                                                       I was looking for a luxury, feel car with great performance at a good price .\\n33                                        Overweight ,  3600 pounds, lots of road noise, and the combined performance of the VCM and the grade logic automatic transmission mke this a miserable driver .\\n34                                                                                                                                 The interior design and the performance of the V6 are the highlights .\\n35                                                                                                        I was looking for a mid size coupe with style, performance and all season traction capability .\\n36                                                                                                         Styling in and out is fantastic, and the v, 6 performance is all one would hope for and more .\\n37                                                                                                                                 It does not diminish the performance of the car, it is just annoying .\\n38         After tracking almost 2 months of research on American and Japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  Honda Accord and Toyota Camry .\\n39                                                   My my, I have never experienced such smooth performance, stability, pick, up, mileage and comfort that I am enjoying with my new 2008 Honda Accord .\\n40                                                                                                                   I admire engine performance and comfort while driving atleast 30 mile a day to job .\\n41                                                                                  I have owned 4 honda's and have come to rely on the fantastic quality of performance and lack of maintenance issues .\\n42                                                                                                    The car is superb, performance, styling, quality, engineering, fit and finish , the whole banana  !\\n43                                                                                                                                                                        The performance is incredible !\\n44                                                                                                                                     Gas mileage is great for a vehicle with this type of performance .\\n45                                                                                                                                     I could not be happier with the performance and ride of this car .\\n46                                                                                        When I first tested the EX, L V6, the performance and handling of the car sold me,  I had to get it and I did .\\n47                                                                                                                                                  Honda has outdone itself on styling and performance .\\n48                                                                                                                                         Its ride, comfort and overall

annoying .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                  My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                      Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                     The voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n18                                                                                                                                                   At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                   the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                    So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                          Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n76

                                                                                                                                                                             Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                     From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80                                                                                                                                                          After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                   Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voice commands are excellent and timely .\\n86                                                                                            The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a

territory .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                               I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n38                    I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The road I live off of, the speed limit is 45, the GPS says that the speed limit is 50 .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                         From what I have seen as far as the speed limit issue is that it is off only by 5mph, but dead on in other places .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n42                                                                                                                      The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n43                                                                                 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I also really like the way it shows my speed and the posted speed limit .\\n45

                                                                                                                                        In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling .\\n47

happen too close to the turns or exits when at highway speeds .\\n49

                                                                                                                                                            This greatly helps the driver to keep his eye on the road instead of looking at the speedometer from time to time .\\n51

One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .\\n53

                                                                                                                 I often find myself wondering if the speed limit changed and I didn't see the sign, so for this one feature I leave the unit on even if it is not navigating to a set location .\\n55

                       I liked the way it tells you the speed limit and how fast you are going .\\n57

             It is cool to always know what the speed limit is and exactly how fast you are traveling   .\\n59

driving in the US  , it displays the speed limit and your speed, which is helpful when converting from Kms to Miles .\\n61

                    SHOWING ACTUAL SPEED IS NICE ,  ESPECIALLY FOR THE LITTLE WOMEN, AS SHE LOVES TO REMIND ME ALONG THE WAY .\\n63

         What I like most about the 255W is that it shows the road's speed limit right above your actual speed, which I find most helpful, since, again, I use it mostly in areas where I'm not familiar with the roads and local speed limits .\\n66
